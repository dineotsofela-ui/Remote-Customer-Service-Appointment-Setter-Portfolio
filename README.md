# Remote-Customer-Service-Appointment-Setter-Portfolio
My portfolio highlights my transition into customer service and appointment setting. It features CRM simulations in Salesforce and HubSpot, where I managed leads, cases, and accounts, while using Calendly to schedule demos, meetings, and follow‑ups. This work reflects my adaptability, technical skills, and readiness to support clients.
